# Polkadot Analytics Platform

### Empowering the Polkadot community with a comprehensive analytics platform that provides natural language querying, supported by formal knowledge representations, and customizable dashboards for holistic data analyses.

# The concept

The Polkadot Analytics Platform aims at building a comprehensive data analysis and visualization tool for the Polkadot ecosystem. The platform will allow users to retrieve and analyze data from various Polkadot-related sources (e.g., different parachains and components such as browser wallets), aligned with the POnto ontology [1, 2, 3]. Users will be able to specify their queries using a controlled natural language (CNL), and the platform will provide a query engine to process these queries. Additionally, the platform will provide a UI to support constructing queries and visualizing informative artifacts that represent query results. As well as support for composing customizable dashboards using these artifacts.
